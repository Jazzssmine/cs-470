> This website documents the features of the current `main` branch of the Just the Docs theme. See [the CHANGELOG]({% link CHANGELOG.md %}) for a list of releases, new features, and bug fixes.

Just the Docs is a theme for generating static websites with [Jekyll]. You can write source files for your web pages using [Markdown], the [Liquid] templating language, and HTML.[^1] Jekyll builds your site by converting all files that have [front matter] to HTML. Your [Jekyll configuration] file determines which theme to use, and sets general parameters for your site, such as the URL of its home page.

Jekyll builds this Just the Docs theme docs website using the theme itself. These web pages show how your web pages will look *by default* when you use this theme. But you can easily *[customize]* the theme to make them look completely different!

Browse the docs to learn more about how to use this theme. -->

## Course Objective

This course aims to provide you with a comprehensive introduction to the science of networks, a foundational concept underlying diverse phenomena such as social networks, auctions, and stock markets. You will explore the theoretical underpinnings of network science, drawing on principles from mathematical sociology and game theory to understand strategic interactions within networks. The course will also equip you with the skills to develop algorithms for identifying key network properties and to create models that explain network dynamics, including phenomena such as viral behavior. By the end of the course, you will be able to apply these concepts to analyze and predict the behavior of complex networks in various real-world contexts.

<!-- {: .note }
See the theme [README][Just the Docs README] for how to use the theme as a gem without creating a new site. -->
